# Esterio
- An Normal-Purpose Discord Bot.
##### I Started this Project as a Fun Project back then at April. I wasn't really too much into this project, But i was doing Atleast 1 single Command a Day and Atleast 2 Systems a Week. Day's passed by i Learned new Things. Then this Project started getting my Interest in. I worked on Good Looking UI's on Commands && Systems. Hosted the Bot in a Cloud Server. Made it a Public Instance and then in Sudden Discord.js(v14) Released, **Ahh am Kind of Guy Who like to Keep His Things UptoDate**. I had to Update Esterio(v13) -> Esterio(14) Exactly Took me *19Hours* To Update and 2 Days to Fix the Errors and The Commands and Dependencies.
